-1/3 + 7/8 = 13/24
13/24 = 0.541667

z = 13/24
-1/3 - 7/8 = -29/24
-29/24 = -1.20833

-1/3 * 7/8 = -7/24
-7/24 = -0.291667

-1/3 / 7/8 = -8/21
-8/21 = -0.380952
Now test additional methods defined
getNumerator:-1 getDenominator:3
The copy object looks just like its parameter, copy = -1/3
-1/3 + 7/8 = 13/24
4/1 + 7/8 = 39/8
-1/3 - 7/8 = 29/24
-1/3 * 7/8 = -7/24
-1/3 / 7/8 = -8/21
-1/3 + 5 = 14/3
5 + -1/3 = 14/3
get values for z
-1/3 is:
 not > 7/8 according to the overloaded > operator
 < 7/8 according to the overloaded < operator
 not >= 7/8 according to the overloaded >= operator
 <= 7/8 according to the overloaded <= operator
 not == 7/8 according to the overloaded == operator
 != 7/8 according to the overloaded != operator
-1/3 + 7/8 = the now changed 13/24
